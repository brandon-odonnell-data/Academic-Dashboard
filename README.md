# Academic-Dashboard
Tools and Languages: Excel

Description and Intent: A secondary school physics department was seeking to make greater use of their academic tracking data in order to better identify trends within and across sets of students, to make better grade predictions and to highlight students struggling in the subject. Names have been anonymised and some data altered within normal academic parameters.

Insights and Reporting: I created a four-part Excel dashboard that linked to the department's data so it would automatically update as new results were entered into the background spreadsheet. It was agreed that the visual representation of results offered an improved snapshot of students' progress that had not been evident when looking at numbers alone. Previous predictions of future student grades were confirmed to be accurate and can now be quicker to make in future. A particularly interesting insight was the partially-overlooked evidence showing that boys are consistently achieving more of the highest grades than girls despite the widely-held belief that girls work harder and more conscientiously.
