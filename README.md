# Academic-Dashboard
Tools and Languages: Excel

Description and Intent: A secondary school physics department was seeking to make greater use of their academic tracking data in order to better identify trends within and across sets of students, to make better grade predictions and to highlight students struggling in the subject. This interactive dashboard of tabular data and chart visualisations was an independently created draft version of the later presented final dashboard in Power BI (not available for presentation here). All data was generated randomly within expected parameters.

Insights and Reporting: I created a four-part Excel dashboard that linked to the fabricated academic data so it would automatically update as new results were entered into the background spreadsheet. It was agreed that such visual representations of results could offer a quicker and improved snapshot of students' progress that was not evident when looking at numbers alone. The eventual Power BI final version confirmed the accuracy of future grade predictions. A particularly interesting insight was the partially-overlooked evidence showing that boys are consistently achieving more of the highest grades than girls despite the widely-held belief that girls work harder and more conscientiously.
